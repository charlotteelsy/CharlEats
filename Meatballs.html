    <center><p> This dish is super easy if you're after a no-fuss but hearty meal. The sauce is particularly easy to make and uses fresh tomatoes to give a 
        delicious flavour.</p></center>
    <center><h3> To make for four people you will need:</h3>
       <center><p class="ingredients">
            <p>250g of Spaghetti</p>
            <p>16 Vegan Meatballs (The Tesco Plant Chef Meatballs work really well)</p>
            <p>20 cherry tomatoes</p>
            <p>4 garlic cloves</p>
            <p>2 tbsp of Tomato Puree</p>
            <p>a handful of fresh basil and 1 tsp of dried oregano</p>
            <p>Salt and Pepper</p>
       </p></center>
       <center><h3> Instructions: </h5></center>
    <center><p class="instructions">Boil some water and add to a pan, before adding the spaghetti. Ensure that the water is 'as salty as the sea'. <br>
        Add some oil to a frying pan and add your meatballs. Cook on a low heat and turn after about 8 minutes. <br>
        Whilst the meatballs are cooking, add the tomatoes, garlic, 3/4 of the basil, oregano and tomato puree to a different frying pan, with a bit of oil. Stir this regularly so it becomes more like a sauce as the tomatoes start to dissolve. Make sure to cook this on a low heat 
        as otherwise it will start to thicken and burn (if this does happen, add some pasta water to thin it out). Add salt and pepper to taste to the sauce. <br>
        Once the sauce has been bubbling for a few minutes and the meatballs are cooked through then add the meatballs to the sauce. To finish, plate your pasta, add the meatballs then top with
        excess sauce and some basil leaves!
